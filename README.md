# Property Accessor Library In PHP

Highly inspired by symfony property access component. This library provides function to
read and write from/to an object or array using a simple string expression. Enforce mode
supported.

## Features:

- Reading/Writing from/to array.
- Reading/Writing from/to object instance using magic __set/__get method.
- Reading/Writing from/to object instance using setter/getter method.
- Reading/Writing from/to object instance in enforce mode to bypass protected/private access modifier.

PR are always welcome :))
